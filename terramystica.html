                        <p class="text-center"> below i will explain what each player will do to get ready for the
                            game.<br>
                            <br>
                            In turn order, selects a faction to play as and takes all
                            components and starting resources needed for that faction.<br>
                            <br>
                            Each player then places one of their dwellings on any space on the board of their home
                            terrain. these dwellings are done for free.<br>
                            <br>
                            Once this is done we go in reverse turn order, places a second dwelling on any space on the
                            board of their
                            home terrain. Don't pay for this dwelling either.<br>
                            <br>
                            and then finally in reverse order again each player claims a bonus tile. Any bonus tiles not
                            claimed get 1 coin
                            placed on them, and the next player to claim these gets the money attached to them.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center">GamePlay</h3>
                        <p class="text-center"> When it is your turn there are multiple things that you may chose from
                            to
                            do. These are as follows.<br>
                            <br>
                            Terraform the land. You may terraform one space any number of spaces. At the beginning of
                            the
                            game, each step of your terraforming track will cost 3 workers, but this can be improved
                            later.
                            The space you are terraforming must be adjacent to an existing building. If this space is
                            now
                            your home terrain, you may build a dwelling by paying the appropriate cost. <br>
                            <br>
                            Improve an existing building. This replaces one building type with another. A dwelling can
                            be
                            upgraded to a trading post. You pay the smaller money cost if it's adjacent to another
                            player,
                            and the bigger cost if it isn't. A trading post can be upgraded to either a stronghold or a
                            temple, and a temple can be upgrade to a sanctuary. If you build a temple or sanctuary, you
                            also
                            get a divine favor. If you build your stronghold, you get another special ability dependent
                            on
                            your faction - see the end of the article for how that works.<br>
                            <br>
                            Improve your terraforming rating. By paying the cost given, you move your terraforming
                            rating up
                            one step, thereby gaining 6 points and reducing the cost for how many workers are required
                            to
                            terraform a space.<br>
                            <br>
                            Improve your shipping rating. By paying the cost given, you move your shipping rating up one
                            step, gaining points. From now on, you may skip over that number of river spaces when
                            determining adjacency.<br>
                            <br>
                            Send a priest to a cult track. Move up the specified number of spaces on the track. If you
                            pass
                            by any gates containing power, gain that amount of power. Priests sent here remain there for
                            the
                            rest of the game. To advance to space 10 of any track, you need a key, gained from forming a
                            town.<br>
                            <br>
                            Take any special action, indicated by an orange octagon. Six of these are on the board, cost
                            power to use, and are first come first served amongst all players. Other actions may be
                            printed
                            on faction boards, divine favors, or bonus tiles.<br>
                            <br>
                            Pass. When you pass, gain any bonus points included on bonus tiles or divine favors, then
                            select
                            a new bonus tile. If you are the first player to pass, you will be the first player in the
                            next
                            round.You no longer take actions for the rest of this round.<br>
                            Depending on the character you have chosen each will have different actions that make them
                            more
                            unique in how they play. this will be included on each of the boards for the characters
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="text-center">End Game</h3>
                        <p class="text-center"> The game ends after 6 rounds. At the end, players earn bonus points
                            based on
                            the
                            following: <br>
                            The player with the largest connected civilization earns 18 points then 12 for 2nd and 6 for
                            3rd.<br>
                            Civilizations are considered "connected" if they are
                            directly adjacent, or can reach each other using their shipping track.<br>
                            If players are tied for a position, add the value for that
                            position and the next, and split it between all players.<br>
                            For each cult track, the player highest on the track score 8 points, the second highest
                            scores
                            4,
                            and the third highest scores 2. Ties are broken the same way they are with largest
                            civilization.<br>
                            For every 3 coins left in your supply, gain 1 point. All resources are automatically
                            downgraded
                            to
                            coins for this.<br>
                            After all this, the player with the most points at the end of the game wins!
